        The rules of this game are pretty simple. Pressing the spacebar fast writes a dot ·, and holding the spacebar produces a dash —. 
        The game consists of three levels. The first one focuses on letters. Tapping the morse code for each letter that appears on the screen
        will bring you to the next letter, until all of them are done. Each letter will come with the code, because the point of this game is to learn.
        The second level is all about words, now testing your ability to quickly remember the different letters. A word will pop up on the screen,
        and you will have to tap the whole thing without timing out. The third level has common codes, like S.O.S. These codes will show
        their meaning as you build muscle memory for them.<br><br>The goal of this game is to complete all three levels with the least amount of 
        mistakes. It is all about learning and mastering Morse Code.<br><br><br>
